-- Puts newsletters back on equal footing with colleagues' email.
--
-- The function below is the ranking as it stood before the bulk-mail term: same
-- signature, same semantic arm, same per-document dedup, no penalty. It is written
-- out in full rather than telling the operator to re-run
-- 20260830100000_brain_search_semantic.sql, because a rollback that depends on
-- finding and running another file is one that fails when you least want it to.
--
-- `meta.bulk` is deliberately left on the chunks. It is a true fact about the mail
-- and costs nothing to keep; only the SCORING of it is reverted here.
