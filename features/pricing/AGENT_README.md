# features/pricing

**Purpose:** Report-purchase pricing math + quote snapshots. Used by `features/checkout/` (build session) and `features/report/` (display "buy" CTAs).

**Entry:**

- `logic/reportPricing.ts` — quote builder, plan price lookup, snapshot serializer. `PLAN_BUCKETS` holds Pricing 3.0's two lists; `pricingArmForReport` picks a reader's (`A3`/`B3`) from their report id, the same rule the re-sync migration uses in SQL.

**Belongs:** pricing math, currency, discount/coupon evaluation, quote snapshots.

**Does NOT belong:**

- Stripe wiring (lives in `features/checkout/server/stripeCheckout.ts`).
- Purchase fulfillment (lives in `features/checkout/server/fulfillment.ts`).
- Report rendering.
