/**
 * Verify Replay Vision findings by running the probe that covers them.
 *
 * A scanner's verdict is a claim about a video. This turns it into evidence, or
 * refuses to: it maps the finding to a criterion from the review protocol, runs
 * that criterion's probe against production, and replies in the Slack thread
 * with what actually happened. No model is involved — a probe cannot
 * hallucinate, which is the entire point.
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-ux-findings.mjs            # verify, post to Slack
 *   node scripts/verify-ux-findings.mjs --dry-run  # verify, print, post nothing
 *
 * WHAT "REPRODUCED" MEANS, EXACTLY. A probe tests production as it is right now,
 * not the recording. So a pass means "the defect the scanner described is NOT
 * present in production today" — which is the question worth answering before
 * anyone writes a fix. It does not prove the reader did not experience it: the
 * bug may have been fixed since, or depend on a device we do not emulate. Both
 * outcomes say so in the message rather than implying more than they know.
 *
 * Secrets are REQUIRED, never optional. Three CI lanes in this repo already skip
 * silently on an unset secret and were dead for weeks before anyone noticed, so
 * this exits non-zero when one is missing instead of reporting success.
